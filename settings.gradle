// TODO: IntelliJ reports `Write access is allowed from write-safe contexts only.` on every build as soon as an adnroid project has been added. Not critical but very annoying.
// TODO: IntelliJ runs wrong gradle task when android subprojects have been added (https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-165274). Workaround is to execute gradle tasks via console.
