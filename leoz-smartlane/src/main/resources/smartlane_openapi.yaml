      summary: Calc route optimized timewindow
      description: |
        Calculates the optimal route(s) for deliveries with (optional) time windows and a common starting point. The deliveries will be distributed to a number of tours according to the available time and vehicle capacities.
        It calls an intelligent algorithm which fits all delivery times into their respective time windows but also results in the shortest possible overall driving time.
        The number of tours will be minimized considering the given time and load volume constraints. if the url parameter "assign_drivers" is set to true, available drivers will automatically assigned to each tour.
        However, it is not necessary to define any drivers beforehand.

        This is per default an asynchroneous process which only returns a Process ID. Results can then be polled (e.g. every second) via "GET /api/process/status/<process_id>/final".
        There is also a possibility to get the results of a finished routing process immediately via Websockets. Please discuss our sample Websocket client implementations with us: support@smartlane.de.
        The routing process can also be called synchroneously by setting the "async" parameter explicitely to false. In this case, no polling is required and results will be returned directly.
        Pleas note that in this synchroneous case, the call might take a while and block the API server while waiting for the response.

        It generates a new route based on existing unfinished (not yet delivered or canceled) deliveries of the route with the given ID. Additionally, it may consume one or both optional ID lists of new deliveries and/or deleted deliveries as body parameter and calculates a route containing "old" and "new" deliveries combined minus the newly deleted deliveries.
        It also sets the status of the "old" route to "route_replaced" and sets the field "replaced_by" to the ID of the new calculated route. Already delivered or canceled delivery objects will not be re-calculated or re-ordered. Notice: All new deliveries must start from the same location (depot) than all already existing ones on the updated route.
